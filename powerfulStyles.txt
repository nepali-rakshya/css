which CSS is more powerful?

1. inline
2. internal
3. external

Answer,

The internal css is stronger compared to external css because of the OVERWRITING.


Again, 

The inline css is the strongest one compared to the internal css because of the OVERWRITING.


Hence,

external css < internal css < inline css.
